## pst2pdf &ndash; Running a PSTricks document with (pdf/xe/lua)latex

## Description

pst2pdf is a Perl script which isolates all PostScript or
PSTricks related parts of the TeX document into single
LaTeX files, for which an eps and pdf image is created.
The pdf ones are then imported in a last pdflatex run
for the pdf output of the main document. The eps and
pdf files are saved in a subdirectory images.

## Usage

```
pst2pdf.pl [options] <file>[.tex|.ltx]
```
or

```
pst2pdf.pl <file>[.tex|.ltx] [options]
```

Relative or absolute `paths` for directories and files is not supported. Options that accept a _value_ require either a blank
space or `=` between the option and the _value_. Some short options can be bundling.

pst2pdf creates a document `file-pdf.tex` for use with pdflatex, which then creates file-pdf.pdf. The created
images are named file-fig-<No>.pdf


If used without `[<options>]` the extracted environments are converted to `pdf` image format
and saved in the `./images` directory using `latex>dvips>ps2pdf` and `preview` package to process `<file>`.
and `pdflatex` to process `<file-pdf>`.

## Restrictions

The pspicture environment can be nested, the postscript one NOT!
pspicture can be inside of a postscript environment, but
not vice versa.

\begin{postscript}
  ...
    \begin{pspicture}
      ....
    \end{pspicture}
  ...
\end{postscript}

The postscript environment should be used for all other
PostScript related commands, which are not part of
a pspicture environment, e.g. nodes inside normal text.
